# notatejs
This is a lightweight javascript annotation library


Check out the [live demo](https://mayankcpdixit.github.io/notatejs/).
Right now it shows one notation at a time. 

data stored in format: `{"start":13,"end":18,"content":"modo","timestamp":1469358419567}`

PS: lots of code is taken from SO as is. references have been provided inside [notateJS](https://github.com/mayankcpdixit/notatejs/blob/master/src/notate.js) file.
